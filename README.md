# Introduction to Apache Struts

This is a collection of files that I have toyed around with in the process of learning Apache Struts.

Struts is an MVC framework. It involves:
1. FilterDispatcher - Controller
2. Action - Model
3. Java Servlet Pages (JSP) - View

It also has things called Interceptors. They perform different tasks:
1. Pre-processing tasks
2. Post-processing tasks
3. Data validation
